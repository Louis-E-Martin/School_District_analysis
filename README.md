# School_District_analysis

## Overveiw
The purpose of this analysis was to calculate and orgnize data for all the schools in a school district and to remove some data that was unwanted in the data set so that it would be more accurate. With this data we are able to quickly see many diffrent metrics such as grades, school budgets and so on that give us insight into how well schools are performing. With this data you could then make a stratagy to improve the schools that are underperforming.
